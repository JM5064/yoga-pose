This project aims to provide accessible yoga instruction with real-time pose guidance through an intelligent computer vision system. Many yoga practitioners may lack access to qualified instructors who can correct form and prevent injuries. By harnessing recent breakthroughs in pose estimation technology, the yoga pose estimator can transform ordinary cameras into yoga assistants capable of recognizing poses, evaluating alignment, and suggesting improvements.

The technical foundation of our system combines a neural network classifier trained on skeletal landmarks from the Yoga-82 dataset with angle-invariant pose recognition algorithms that function regardless of camera position. This enables three core capabilities: accurate identification of yoga poses in real-time video streams (even with multiple practitioners), personalized alignment feedback through comparison of practitioner form against reference models, and an intelligent pose recommendation engine that creates varied, fluid sequences based on pose similarity metrics and a stochastic weighted graph structure. Unlike existing solutions that merely identify poses, our system delivers specific verbal cues for improvement ("straighten your right arm," "widen your stance") and builds natural pose progressions that maintain the flow essential to yoga practice. The result is a comprehensive yoga guidance system that makes proper technique accessible to practitioners of all levels without specialized equipment or in-person instruction.
